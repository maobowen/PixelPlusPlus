Pixel++ is a programming language for efficient manipulation of images coded in OCaml.

# 1 Introduction

## 1.1 Overview

In this document, we propose Pixel++, a domain-specific language designed for efficient manipulation on images, which contains features that allow users to edit image with convenience and conciseness. Pixel++ provides a foundation for image processing through the development of powerful yet simple primitive data types, operators, built-in functions and standard library. We will demonstrate the usability of Pixel++ by explaining the essential components in a programming language such as architectural design, reference manual, language testing, etc.

## 1.2 Aims and Motivations

Since posting photos on social media has become an important part of people’s lives in the 21<sup>st</sup> century, it would bring a huge impact to the society if one can create a tool to help people easily edit photos and apply effects on them to reach goals such as expressing feelings or conveying messages. While Photoshop and some other cutting-edge software do a pretty good job at image editing, most of them still requires a large amount of manual labor. There exists few programming languages or software that enable automatic image manipulation. Therefore, we designed the Pixel++ programming language, which enables users to modify an image by changing its RGB pixel values.

## 1.3 Context

Our programming language represents an image as an integer array and stores the pixel values in that array. We allow user to add effects on images by self-defined filters or Pixel++’s pre-defined filters, and we provide filter operators for users to apply convolution matrices on images. In order to process images presented in arrays, we also provide operators such as component-wise multiplication operator, transpose operator, subscript operator, etc. Additionally, there are built-in functions for users to load images, initialize blank images, set  height and width of a filter, etc. and a standard library for users to crop, rotate, flip, collage and apply sci-fi effect to images. These features give users the flexibility to transform their images by simply operating on the arrays. 

The syntax of Pixel++ is similar to the syntax of C, excluding some  irrelevant details such as inheritance, template, etc. Since Pixel++ includes the array data type and other relative operators, it does not only implement image processing but also grants users the ability to manipulate images on a pixel scale and the freedom to define their own filters based on individual preference.

Combining these features could considerably simplify real-life tasks such as adjusting brightness and contrast of images, editing the sizes, flipping and concatenating images, adding interesting effects on images, and so on.

- Ubuntu 17.10 with [OCaml 4.04](https://packages.ubuntu.com/artful/ocaml) and LLVM 6.0.

To set up the environment, please run the following commands:

```bash
#!/bin/bash 

LLVM_VERSION=6.0
OCAML_LLVM_VERSION=6.0.0
UBUNTU_CODENAME=`lsb_release --codename | cut -f2`
UBUNTU_VERSION=`lsb_release -r | awk '{ print $2 }' | sed 's/[.]//'`
if [ ${UBUNTU_VERSION} -lt 1804 ]; then

fi
sudo apt update

# Install OCaml and LLVM
sudo apt install ocaml opam m4 clang-${LLVM_VERSION} llvm-${LLVM_VERSION} llvm-${LLVM_VERSION}-runtime cmake pkg-config build-essential
opam init

# Install OCaml LLVM library
opam install llvm.${OCAML_LLVM_VERSION}
tee -a ~/.bashrc << EOF
export PATH="/usr/lib/llvm-${LLVM_VERSION}/bin:\$PATH"
eval \`opam config env\`
EOF
```

You may also run the following command to take changes into effect:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

### 2.1.2 macOS

Our compiler has been tested on

- macOS 10.13 with [OCaml 4.06](http://formulae.brew.sh/formula/ocaml) and [LLVM 6.0](http://formulae.brew.sh/formula/llvm@6).

To set up the environment, please run the following commands (with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installed):

```bash
brew update
brew install ocaml opam llvm
echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/llvm/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile
opam init
eval `opam config env`
opam install llvm.6.0.0
```

## 2.2 Building Pixel++ Compiler

After you setup your environment correctly, the first thing you should do is to build our Pixel++ compiler. We provide a Makefile to make this process convenient for you. To build the compiler, just use the following command:

```bash
make
```

## 2.3 Compiling and Running Your Pixel++ Program

First things first: pick up your favorite text editor, and write a Pixel++ program! You can just copy and paste the sample program in Section [2.4](#24-a-sample-program), name it as `myprogram.xpp`, and put it under the root directory of the compiler. Don't forget to include your favorite images (only PNG format is supported). If you use the sample program, just name an image as `image.png`.

Now let's compile our program step by step.

First, compile the Pixel++ program and produce an LLVM IR `myprogram.ll`:

```bash
./toplevel.native myprogram.xpp > myprogram.ll
```

Next, Invokes the LLVM compiler to produce an assembly file `myprogram.s`:

```bash
llc myprogram.ll > myprogram.s
```

If you would like to use any functions in the standard library to process images (for example, the sample program in Section [2.4](#24-a-sample-program) uses a sci-fi effect filter in the stardary library), compile the file `stdlib.xpp`:

```bash
make -C stdlib/
./stdlib/toplevel.native -c2 ./stdlib/stdlib.xpp > stdlib.llllc stdlib.ll > stdlib.s
gcc -std=c99 -Wall -c load.c
```

Now produce an executable `myprogram.exe` for the Pixel++ program if you do not use functions in the standard library:

```bash
gcc -Wall myprogram.s -o myprogram.exe
```

If you use any functions in the standard library, link all the assembly files and object files and produce the executable:

```
gcc -Wall myprogram.s stdlib.s load.o -lm -o myprogram.exe
```

> You might need to add the `-no-pie` flag to GCC if you experience any relocation errors when linking on Ubuntu 18.04.

Finally, run your executable and see the result:

```bash
./myprogram.exe
```

If you follow our sample program, you can find a file named `image2.png` generated under the root directory. Check it out and see what has happened!

You can also clean intermediate files and executables before building the top-level executables using:

```
make clean
make -C stdlib/ clean
```

## 2.4 A Sample Program

Since Pixel++ is designed for image processing, let’s look at a beginner program on how to manipulate images in Pixel++.

```cpp
func int main() {
    arr img1 = load("./image.png");
    scifi_filter(img1);
    save(img1, "./image2.png");
    close(img1, 0);
    return 0;
}
```

- Line 1: Every Pixel++ program must have a main function. It’s the entry point of a Pixel++ program. 
- Line 2: `load()` function loads the picture file `image.png` from the disk into a variable `img1`. Every image in Pixel++ is of type `arr`, which stands for array. `load()` is a built-in function provided by Pixel++. `save()` and `close()` are also built-in functions. To see a full list of built-in functions, please refer to Section [3.8.3](#383-built-in-function). 
- Line 3: `scifi_filter()` applies the sci-fi effect filter to the loaded image. `scifi_filter()` is a function in the Pixel++ standard library. Other standard library functions include `crop()`, `collage()`, `flip()`, etc. To see a full list of functions in the standard library, please refer to Section [3.9](#39-standard-library).
- Line 4: The built-in `save()` function saves the changes you made on the image to the disk. 
- Line 5: Don’t forget to close the image file when you are done manipulating the image using the built-in `close()` function.

## 3.2 Notations

In this document, codes are `highlighted`. For example:

> The following code declares a 1-dimension array of 32-bit signed integers and assigns values to it:
>
>     arr a;
>     a = [1, 2, 3];

## 3.3 Lexical Conventions

### 3.3.1 Whitespace

Since Pixel++ is a free-format language, styling with whitespace characters, including spaces, tabs, and line breaks, does not matter. All the whitespace characters will be ignored during scanning.

However, we encourage users to use four spaces, two spaces or one tab for indention.

### 3.3.2 Identifiers

A valid identifier is a literal that

- differs from any keywords defined in Section [3.3.3](#333-reserved-words), and
- starts with a letter of either uppercase or lowercase (i.e. 'A'-'Z', 'a'-'z'), and
- follows any combination of numbers, uppercase or lowercase letters, and underscore (i.e. '0'-'9', 'A'-'Z', 'a'-'z', '\_').

Identifiers are generally used to declare variables (including image filters) or functions. Since Pixel++ is a case-sensitive language, uppercase letters and lowercase letters will be treated differently.

### 3.3.3 Reserved Words

Keywords are reserved by the language so that they cannot be used for other purposes (e.g. the name of an identifier). These words include:

- Primitive data types (see Section [3.3.4](#334-data-types)): `arr`, `bool`, `float`, `int`, `kernel`, `string`, `void`;
- Boolean values: `true`, `false`;
- Control flow (See Section [3.3.6](#336-control-flow)): `else`, `for`, `if`, `return`, `while`;
- Function declaration (See Section [3.5.2](#352-function-declaration)): `func`.

Some words are reserved by the language as built-in functions. Users are welcome to call these functions, but they are not expected to use these words to name other functions. These words include:

- Built-in functions (See Section [3.8.3](#383-built-in-function)): `close`, ``float_of`, height`, `imgcpy`, `init`, `int_of`, `length`, `load`, `print`, `printf`, `printline`, `save`, `set`, `width`.

Some words are reserved in the standard library `stdlib.xpp`. Users are welcome to call these functions or filters, but they should not use these words for other purposes provided that the standard library will be linked during compilation. These words include:

- Standard library functions (See Section [3.9](#39-standard-library)): `collage`, `crop`, `flip`, `rotate`, `scifi_filter`.

Some other words are reserved by the language or the standard library `stdlib.xpp`. They are “helper functions” for developers, and thus users are neither expected to call these functions nor to use these words to name other functions. These words include:

- Built-in functions: `f_len`, `get_filter`;
- Standard library functions: `apply_conv_filter`, `apply_conv_filters`, `exp`, `exp2`, `mtimes`, `transpose`.

### 3.3.4 Data Types

There are seven primitive data types in the language specification of Pixel++.

- `void`: `void` is only used as the return type of functions which have no return values. Variables **cannot** be declared as `void` type.
- `int`: A 32-bit signed integer ranging from -2<sup>31</sup> to 2<sup>31</sup>-1.
- `float`: A 32-bit signed floating point number.
- `bool`: A boolean value, either `true` or `false`.
- `string`: A sequence of characters. A `string` is **immutable**.
- `arr`: A container storing a sequence of `int` (32-bit signed integer) values. An `arr` is of **fixed length** but **mutable**.
- `kernel`: A container storing a sequence of image filters. For more details, please see Section [3.6.2](#362-image-filter-expression).

### 3.3.5 Operators

Operator | Description
--- | ---
`*`, `/` `+`, `-` | *Arithmetic operators. (Binary)*<br>Arithmetic addition, subtraction, multiplication and division for scalars.
`^` | *Arithmetic operator. (Binary)*<br>Exponentiation for scalars.
`:*` | *Matrix&#42; arithmetic operator. (Binary)*<br>Component-wise multiplication for matrices. The two matrices need to have the same shape.
`**` | *Matrix&#42; arithmetic operator. (Unary)*<br>Transpose operation of a matrix.
`==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=` | *Relational operators. (Binary)*<br>Relational operators which return boolean values.
`not`, `and`, `or` | *Logical operators. (Unary / binary)*<br>Short-circuit Logical operators which evaluate boolean expressions.
`->` | *Stacking operator. (Binary)*<br>Stacking filters.
`@` | *Filtering operator. (Binary)*<br>Apply a stack of filters to an image.
`=` | *Assignment operator. (Binary)*<br>Assign a value or an object to a variable.
`[]` | *Subscript operator. (Binary)*<br>Subscript operator, which takes the index and returns the element of that index inside a collection.
`()` | *Parentheses.*<br>Parentheses are mandatory in condition clauses or boolean expressions. Parentheses also serve as the function call operator.
`||` | *Filter parentheses.*<br>Parentheses are mandatory to group the filters.

*&#42; Please refer to Section [3.6.1](#361-mathematical-expression) for more information about matrices.*

Below is the operator precedence (from high to low):

1. `()`, `[]`, `||`
2. `**`, `:*`, `^` (left associative)
3. `*`, `/`, `+`, `-` (left associative)
4. `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=` (left associative)
5. `not`, `and`, `or` (left associative)
6. `->` (left associative)
7. `@` (non-associative)
8. `=` (right associative)

### 3.3.6 Control Flow

If there is only one line of statement in the block, the block `{}` can be omitted. Any dangling `else` in this case will be associated to the nearest `if`. However, we strongly recommend users to use blocks to avoid ambiguity.

Type | Explanation| Example
--- | ---
if | The basic control flow statement. Codes inside the `if` block will execute only if the condition is evaluated to `true`. | `if (condition) { }`
if-else | Provide an `else` path when the condition is evaluated to `false`. | `if (condition) { } else { }`
if-else if | Can evaluate another condition other than the first one. | `if (condition1) { } else { if (condition2) { } }`
for-loop | Started by an initialization, execute and update over every iteration when the condition is evaluated as `true`. | `for (initial; condition; update) { }`
while-loop | Execute over every iteration when the condition is evaluated as `true`. | `while (condition) { }`

### 3.3.7 Comment Style

`/* ... */` is used for multi-line comments. All content wrapped between `/*` and `*/` will be ignored.

### 3.3.8 Separator

Semicolon `;` is used as statement separator.

## 3.4 Literals

### 3.4.1 Integer Literals

A sequence of digits formed by 0-9. Integer literals are associated with the `int` data type. Examples: `1`, `2`, `3`.

### 3.4.2 Float Literals

A sequence of digits starts by 0-9, followed by a floating point '`.`' and another sequence of digits of 0-9. Float literals are associated with the `float` data type. Examples: `1.0`, `2.0`, `3.0`.

### 3.4.3 Boolean Literals

`true` and `false`.

### 3.4.4 String Literals

A sequence of characters enclosed by double quotation marks `""`. String literals are associated with `string` data type. Examples: `"Pixel++"`, `"Programming Languages and Translators"`.

### 3.4.5 Array Literals

A sequence of list of zero or more literals of the `int` type, each of which represents an array element, enclosed by squared brackets `[]`. Array literals are associated with the `arr` data type. An array literal is always 1-dimensional. Example: `[1, 2, 3]`, `[4, 5, 6]`.

## 3.5 Declarations

### 3.5.1 Variable Declaration

Type declaration is required when declaring a variable. For example, to declare an integer variable `a`, a valid declaration will be:

```cpp
int a;
```

Alternatively, Pixel++ offers the freedom to combine the declaration and initialization. For instance, the following statements are also correct:

```cpp
int a = 0;
float b = 0.0;
bool c = true;
arr d = [1, 2, 3];
```

### 3.5.2 Function Declaration

Function declaration should have the following structure:

```cpp
func return_type function_name(type1 argument1, type2 argument2, ...)
{
    statement1;
    ...
}
```

For example:

```cpp
func int add(int a, int b)
{
    return a + b;
}
```

In the above example, `func` is a reserved keyword of Pixel++ indicating the beginning of a function declaration. `int` followed right after `func` is the return type of the function. `add` is the name of the function, which can be defined by the users. Inside the parentheses is a list of argument variables (with type) passed to the function. For each argument variable `a` and `b`, it is required to specify their return types. The main body of the function is wrapped by the `{}` block, which is mandatory.

## 3.6 Expressions

### 3.6.1 Mathematical Expression

A mathematical expression contains operators, identifiers, and literals. An example to add an integer variable `a` and a scalar `2` would be (assuming `a` and `b` have already been declared and `a` has been initialized):

```cpp
b = a + 2
```

Additionally, Pixel++ offers two matrix operators: component-wise multiplication and transpose. Pixel++ **does not** have a native matrix type. Here, a matrix means **a 1-dimensional array with height and width**, which looks like a 2-dimensional array. For more information, please refer to Section [3.8.3](#383-built-in-function) and [3.11.1](#3111-images-and-filters). Some examples of valid matrix expressions would be:

```cpp
m = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9];
set(m, 3, 3);

m2 = **m      /* Transpose */
m3 = m :* m2  /* Component-wise multiplication */
```

### 3.6.2 Image Filter Expression

An image filter expression contains operators `@` and `->`. `@` means operating on an image and `->` means stacking filters. For example, if we have two filters `blur` and `smooth`, `blur->smooth` means first applying the blurring filter and then the smoothing filter (since in this example `smooth` is physically closer to the `image` operand). Valid filtering expressions can be:

```cpp
func void applyFilter()
{
    arr image = load("~/image/image.png");
    arr blur = [1, 4, 7, 4, 1, 4, 16, 26, 16, 4, 7, 26, 41, 26, 7, 4, 16, 26, 16, 4, 1, 4, 7, 4, 1];
    arr smooth = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 4, 4, 1, 1, 4, 12, 4, 1, 1, 4, 4, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1];
    set(blur, 5, 5);
    set(smooth, 5, 5);
    kernel k = |blur->smooth| /* Stack filters to a kernel */
    k@image;                  /* Apply a kernel to an image */
    save(image, "~/image/image2.png");
}
```

## 3.7 Statements

All expressions plus semi-colon are statements. In addition, there are control flow statements and `return` statements.

### 3.7.1 If Statement

An `if` statement contains conditionals with `bool` data type.

A valid `if` statement can be:

```cpp
if (a > b)
{
    a = a - b;
} 
else
{
    b = b - a;
}
```

### 3.7.2 While Statement

A `while` statement contains conditionals with `bool` data type.

A valid `while` statement can be:

```cpp
func int gcd(int a, int b)
{
    while (a != b)
    {
        if (a > b)
        {
            a = a - b;
        }
        else
        {
            b = b - a;
        }
    }
    return a;
}
```

### 3.7.3 For Statement

A `for` statement contains pre-statements (initialization), conditionals and post-statements (update).

A valid `for` statement can be:

```cpp
func int forLoopTest()
{
    int b = 10;
    int accu = 0;
    int i;
    for (i = 0; i < b; i = i + 1)
    {
        accu = accu + i;
    }
    return accu;
}
```

### 3.7.4 Return Statement

A `return` statement returns the result of a function with the same type of the return type defined in the function declaration. It is optional. For more detail, please refer to Section [3.8.1](#381-function-definition).

A valid `return` statement can be:

```cpp
func int main()
{
    int result = gcd(5050,100);
    return result;
}
```

## 3.8 Function

### 3.8.1 Function Definition

A function is a piece of code that can be invoked repeatedly in the program. In Pixel++, a function definition is composed of two parts: function signature and function body. A function signature must contain a `func` keyword, return type, function name and a formal argument list.

```cpp
func return_type function_name ( formal_list ) 
{
    function_body
}
```

`func` is a reserved keyword for function definition which cannot be ignored.

`return_type` can be any primitive type defined in Pixel++, including `arr` and `kernel`. It must be explicitly specified even when no return value is expected, in which case `void` is used.

`function_name` should be a valid identifier in Pixel++. It cannot be any reserved words. For more information, please refer to Section [3.3.3](#333-reserved-words).

`formal_list` is a list of zero or more formals, separated by commas. A formal is a pair of argument type and its name. An argument type can be any primitive data type and an argument name should be a valid identifier:

```cpp
formal_list: (type arg (, type arg)*)?
```

A function body is a list of zero or more statements, including expressions, statement blocks, control-flow statements, return statements, local variable declarations and assignments. A return statement is optional, but if one exists, the value of it must match `return_type` specified in the function signature. Pixel++ does not require declaration of local variables before any other statements. Users can declare local variables anywhere in the function body, as long as the declarations comes before using them. Pixel++ also supports local variable declaration and assignment (initialization) in one statement:

```cpp
type variable_name = expression;
```

Pixel++ does not support nested function definition. Functions can only be defined globally, which means that a function can not be defined within the body of another function.

### 3.8.2 Function Call

Function call in Pixel++ is in the following form:

```cpp
function_name( argument_list )
```

`function_name` should be a valid identifier. `argument_list` is a list of zero or more arguments, separated by commas. An argument must be a valid expression in Pixel++:

```cpp
argument_list: (expr (, expr)*)?
```

To correctly invoke a function, the function name, the number and types of arguments must match a defined function signature exactly. Pixel++ does not support automatic type conversion in function calls, so passing a `float` value to a function demanding `int` argument will issue a compiler error.

A function call is itself an expression, so it can be used in the program wherever an expression can be used.

Pixel++ does not support first-class function, so a function can not be passed as an argument in a function call.

## 3.10 Program

### 3.10.1 Scope Rules

In Pixel++, global variables are the variables declared at the main body of the program, which can be accessed anywhere in the rest of the files. If a variable is declared within a function, its scope is limited within the function block. Variables declared in if-else or while blocks will also have the scopes limited within the corresponding blocks.

### 3.10.2 Program Flow

There is an entry point of the program, which is the `main()` function. If the program lacks this function, it will raise an exception.

The whole program consists of a mixture of declarations, statements, and functions.

## 3.11 Supplementary Notes on Image Operations

### 3.11.1 Images and Filters

If an image is loaded by the `load` built-in function, for example, `arr image = load(image.png);`, users **do not need** to set the height and the width, since it is read from an external file.

If an image is created by the `init` built-in function, for example, `arr image = init(768 * 1024 * 3, 768, 1024);`, users **do not need** to set the height and the width, since they have been recorded by the arguments.

If a filter is created by the Pixel++ statement `arr filter = [1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1];` and its shape is 3 &times; 3, the compiler only knows that its length is 9. It does not know the height or the width. Therefore, users **need** to use the built-in function `set(filter, 3, 3);` to set the height and the width manually.

### 3.11.2 Pixels

The array storing the pixels of an image is thus in row-major order. Therefore, the pixel on row `x` and column `y` is on the position `(x, y)`. To get the RGB color values of the pixel on position `(x, y)`:

```cpp
int w = width(img);
int red   = img[(x * w + y) * 3];      /* Red value on (x, y) */
int green = img[(x * w + y) * 3 + 1];  /* Green value on (x, y) */
int blue  = img[(x * w + y) * 3 + 2];  /* Blue value on (x, y) */
```

## 3.12 Code Listings

We will demonstrate three programs which illustrate the key features of Pixel++. For more sample programs, please refer to the test suites for [Deliverable #4 Hello World](https://github.com/maobowen/PixelPlusPlus/tree/master/helloworld_tests), [Deliverable #5 Extended Testsuite](https://github.com/maobowen/PixelPlusPlus/tree/master/extended_tests) and [Demo](https://github.com/maobowen/PixelPlusPlus/tree/master/demo).

### 3.12.1 Greatest common divisor (GCD)

The following codes demonstrate how to calculate the greatest common divisor by using our language.

```cpp
func int gcd(int a, int b)
{
    while (a != b) {
        if (a > b) {
            a = a - b;
        }
        else { 
            b = b - a;
        }
    }
    return a;
}
```

### 3.12.2 Image Filters

The following codes demonstrate how to apply a filter on an image object with our special filtering operator `->` and `@`.

```cpp
func int main() {
    arr image = load("~/Documents/image1.png");
    /* Define a filter for blurring */
    arr blur = [1, 4, 7, 4, 1, 4, 16, 26, 16, 4, 7, 26, 41, 26, 7, 4, 16, 26, 16, 4, 1, 4, 7, 4, 1];
    set(blur, 5, 5);
        
    kernel k = |blur->blur|; /* Concatenate filters to a kernel */
    k@img;                   /* Apply the kernel to the image */
    save(image1, "~/Documents/image1_blurred.png");
    close(image, 0);
    return 0;
}
```

### 3.12.3 Image Operations

The following code snippet demonstrates our featured image operating functions “collage”, “crop” and “flip”.

```cpp
func void main()
{
    arr image1 = load("~/Documents/image1.png");
    arr image2 = load("~/Documents/image2.png");  /* Suppose image2 has the same width as image1 */
    arr image3 = collage(image1, image2);         /* Concatenate two images vertically */
    arr image4 = flip(image3);                    /* Concatenate the images horizontally */
    arr image5 = crop(image4, 0, 350, 540, 300);  /* Crop the images */
    save(image5, "~/Documents/image_transformed.png");
}
```

# 4 Project Plan

## 4.1 Process Overview

We started the proposal discussion from the first week and held regular meetings every one or two weeks. Due to a common interest, we decided to design an image processing language. We met before each deliverable submissions to make sure that our work had met the requirements. During the meetings with Nimo Ni, our TA, we also received much advice on our project progress. Therefore, even though we did not have much experience on computer vision or related fields before, the whole process went smoothly.

As for the specification process, we started by defining our expected functionalities. Aiming at the image domain, we expected our language to be able to apply some transformations to image files. After we agreed on the proposal, we then defined our language rules and started coding up the scanner and parser. Though, we added several new rules by ourselves, such as the filter rules based on our discussions. As we went through each stage, we were getting closer to our original expectation. Certainly, modification of our original plan was necessary. Once we found some issues that would require us to make a big change, we would hold a meeting to discuss it together.

During the development, we divided work among us in each meeting. We set up a Github repository to cooperate: <https://github.com/maobowen/PixelPlusPlus>. It had been difficult for us to divide the work at the beginning since we were not familiar with OCaml and MicroC at all. During that period, we met and went through the codes of MicroC together to understand the process before we could figure out how we should start the work. We met with our TA and took meeting minutes for our later reference. The situation got better as we were more familiar with the compiling process and the whole structure. Therefore, in the following stages, each of us was mainly responsible for one component, and we worked on the same branch before merging to our master branch.

## 4.5 Software Development Environment

### 4.5.1 Environment

At the early stage, our development environment varies among each individual, which includes macOS 10.13, Ubuntu 16.04 and Ubuntu 17.10. To make sure everyone had the same working environment, we later set up a shared virtual machine with Ubuntu 14.04 hosted on Google Compute Engine. In this virtual machine, we used OCaml 4.02 and LLVM 6.0. We have tested our compiler on other environments as well. For more information, please refer to Section [2.1](#21-environment-setup).

### 4.5.2 Tool

We used text editor includes Sublime Text and Vim for the development. For version control, we set up Github repository to cooperate. Google drive is also set up for recording our questions and meeting minutes.

### 4.5.3 Language

**OCaml**: OCaml is the major language for writing Pixel++. All the components except for the standard library functions are written in OCaml.

**C**: C libraries (including the Single-file header-file libraries for reading and writing images) are linked during the implementation of image processing. Some functions such as `print()` are also implemented by them.

**C++**: We wrote C++ programs to verify the correctness of the standard library functions which involve image generations.

In addition, we wrote Bash scripts to batch test our test cases.

# 5 Architectural Design

## 5.1 Translator Components

![Architecture](./images/architecture.png)

## 5.2 Interfaces

### 5.2.1 Scanner and Lexer

The scanner scans the Pixel++ source code, and the lexer tokenize them and pass the results to the parser.

### 5.2.2 Parser

The parser receives the tokens generated by the lexer and generates an abstract syntax tree. We have extended the tree node types of MicroC. Since our language supports array type and filter operations on array, we added several node types such as array literal and filter list. The abstract syntax tree will then be passed to the semantic checker.

### 5.2.3 Semantic Checker

The semantic checker ensures that the abstract syntax tree generated by the parser is semantically correct. For example, it will check if operands of an operation are of the correct types, as well as there are no duplicate definitions of variables or functions in the same scope. Additionally, since we implemented the standard libraries for Pixel++, we have two versions of `semant.ml`. [One](https://github.com/maobowen/PixelPlusPlus/blob/master/semant.ml) is for the user's source file, and it will reject the translating process if a user defines a function which has the same name as any built-in functions or standard library functions. [The other](https://github.com/maobowen/PixelPlusPlus/blob/master/stdlib/semant.ml) is for the language's standard library functions written in `stdlib.xpp`. This is necessary since we defined the standard library functions in `stdlib.xpp`, and we don't expect the semantic checker to reject the translation when it spots that functions in `stdlib.xpp` use function names reserved for the standard library functions. In either case the semantic checker will generate a semantically-checked abstract syntax tree (SAST) and passes it to the code generator part.

### 5.2.4 Code Generator

The code generator visits the SAST from the semantic checker. It then translates functions and variables into LLVM IR. Similar to the semantic checkers, we also have two versions of `codegen.ml` and they are for the user source code and the `stdlib.xpp` respectively. There are two ways for the general `codegen.ml` to implement the built-in or standard library functions. One is to look up the function definition of a standard library function in the object file generated by `stdlib.xpp` and then run the function. The other is to insert related LLVM instructions into the module when codegen finds a user calls a built-in functions, which usually requires fewer than 10 lines of LLVM instructions and is the case for getting or setting the length, height and width for a matrix represented as an array.

### 5.2.5 C Libraries

We utilized the [Single-file public domain libraries](https://github.com/nothings/single_file_libs) to implement reading a PNG image file and saving an image in the PNG format. We also used C's `malloc()` and `free()` to manage memory resources.

# 6 Test Plan

## 6.1 Test Strategies

For Deliverable #2 "Scanner and Parser", 5 positive test cases and 5 negative test cases are placed under the folder [`syntax_tests`](https://github.com/maobowen/PixelPlusPlus/tree/master/syntax_tests). Each positive test case contains two files: `test-*.xpp` is the source code of the test program, and `test-*.out` is the expected output of the parser. Similarly, each negative test case also contains two files: `fail-*.xpp` is the source code of the test program, and `fail-*.out` is the error message that the parser is expected to generate. The Bash script `test-syntax.sh` in the root folder iterates all the source program inside the folder `syntax_tests`. For each test case, it executes `./toplevel.native -a`, calling the parser to generate the output file (`test-*.xpp.out` or `fail-*.xpp.err`). Then the script runs `diff` to compare each output file with the expected output (`test-*.out` or `fail-*.err`) and see whether whether there are differences between the expected and the actual outputs.

Deliverable #4 "Hello World" uses the similar strategies. 5 test cases are placed under the folder [`helloworld_tests`](https://github.com/maobowen/PixelPlusPlus/tree/master/helloworld_tests). This time each expected output file `test-helloworld-*.out` contains the output of the corresponding source program `test-helloworld-*.xpp`. For each test case, the Bash script `test-helloworld.sh` in the root folder first executes `./toplevel.native -l` to generate the LLVM IR (`test-helloworld-*.ll`). Then it calls LLVM's Clang compiler `clang` to generate the executable (`test-helloworld-*`), runs it to generate the output of the source program (`test-helloworld-*.xpp.out`) and compares the expected and the actual outputs.

The test for Deliverable #5 "Extended Testsuite" is more complicated. 7 positive test cases and 3 negative test cases are placed under the folder [`extended_tests`](https://github.com/maobowen/PixelPlusPlus/tree/master/extended_tests). For the negative test cases (`extended-neg-*`), the strategies are still similar to those in Deliverable #2 "Scanner and Parser". For the positive cases (`extended-pos-*`), the Bash script `test-extended.sh` in the root folder first executes `./toplevel.native` to generate the LLVM IR (`extended-pos-*.ll`). Next, it calls LLVM static compiler `llc` to compile LLVM source inputs into assembly language (`extended-pos-*.s`), and calls GNU C compiler `gcc` to link the assemblies and the object file together to generate the executable (`extended-pos-*`). Then it runs the executable to generate either the output of the source program (in the last positive test case) or the output image.

Checking the output of the last positive test case is similar to Deliverable #4. For the other positive test cases, they produce images, which need extra works to check. Each source program is implemented equivalently in C++ (`extended-pos-*-v.cpp`), which only involves the Single-file public domain library. For each test case, the Bash script calls GNU C++ compiler `g++` to compile the C++ program and runs it to produce another image for verification. Then it calculates and compares the SHA-256 hashes for both images. If the hash values match, the source program works properly.

The test for demo is almost the same as that for Deliverable #5. 3 positive test cases are placed under the folder [`demo`](https://github.com/maobowen/PixelPlusPlus/tree/master/demo), and the Bash script is `test-demo.sh`.

Even though it is not encouraged to write a C++ program (or a program in any other languages) to verify whether or not a Pixel++ program works (since we could have made mistakes in the C++ program), this is the only way as well as the best method that we could adopt so far.
