arr img = load("./img2.png");
(If an image is created by "load" function, you don't need to set height/ width since it's read from the png file)
(If an image is crated via arr img = init(length, height, width), you don't need to set height/ width since it is recorded by passing the elements length/ height/ width)
(If a kernel/filter is created via arr filter = [1,3,1, 1,3,1, 1,3,1], and if it's 3 by 3, the compiler knows its length is 9, but doesn't know the height/ width. You need to use the builtin function, which is not ready yet, but you can assume it exists, to write set_hw(filter, 3, 3) for example)

Row-major order:

To get the pixel on (i,j):

int h = height(img);
ing w = width(img);

int red_pixel = img[(i * w + j) * 3]; // red pixel on (i, j)
int green_pixel = img[(i * w + j) * 3 + 1]; // green pixel on (i, j)
int blue_pixel = img[(i * w + j) * 3 + 2]; // blue pixel on (i, j)
